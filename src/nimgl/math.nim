## `return <../>`_.  
##
## A Math library that helps with linear algebra. It is built on the idea
## to directly interact with opengl.
## This module exposes the std math's module and is packed together with
## usefull functions to help interface with opengl. We use the std math's module
## to avoid rewriting what has already been writen.
